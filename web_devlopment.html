	<LI><b>Realme Narzo 10A</b></LI>
	<P style="font-size: 25px">
	The Narzo 10a adds a fingerprint sensor, which takes care of one of our biggest complaints with the C3, as well as a macro camera on the rear, which is fun to use but not very practical. Performance is excellent thanks to the MediaTek Helio G70 processor, and you can get a decent enough gaming experience even with today's heavy games. The cameras are just about average, but quality dips a lot in low light. Battery life is excellent and we could get two full days of casual usage out of a single charge. This phone is available in So White and So Blue, with a gigantic Realme logo emblazoned across the back. Only one configuration is available, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.  </P>
